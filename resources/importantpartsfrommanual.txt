The Medtronic uses a series of timers and intervals to function.
- base rate interval
- A-V interval
- lots more


DDD Mode
This mode provides a P-wave synchronous rate response with A-V 
sequential pacing. Intrinsic activity in the atrium and ventricle 
inhibits output stimuli and restarts certain timers. 
Without atrial events within certain periods, the pacemaker 
delivers a pacing stimulus to the atrium at the end of the 
V-A interval which is equal to the programmed base RATE minus 
the programmed A-V INTERVAL. 

Without ventricular activity during certain periods, the pacemaker 
delivers a pacing stimulus to the ventricle at the end of the 
programmed A-V INTERVAL. An exception to this is safety 
pacing, which is illustrated in the diagrams. 
The pacing rate can be limited by the programmed UPPER RATE
so that the pacemaker does not pace the ventricle too fast in the 
presence of atrial arrhythmias.

When pacing in the DDD mode, the pacemaker will pace the 
atrium and the ventricle at the programmed base RATE and with 
the programmed A-V INTERVAL in the absence of detected atrial 
or ventricular intrinsic events
